This project utilizes the Pandas library for data manipulation and Plotly for creating interactive visualizations. The goal is to uncover trends related to bike rentals in relation to time of day, weather, holidays, and seasons.
# Bike Rentals Analysis

## Description
This project performs an analysis of bike rental data over a period of time, exploring the relationship between various factors such as holidays, seasons, and weather conditions with the number of rented bikes. The analysis includes various visualizations using Plotly, such as time series plots, bar charts, and scatter plots.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning (handling missing values, type conversions)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of bike rentals
- Visualizations:
  - Line plot showing rented bikes over time
  - Total rented bikes per day
  - Rented bikes by season
  - Temperature vs rented bikes
  - Hourly bike usage patterns
  - New Year's rental usage

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- plotly
